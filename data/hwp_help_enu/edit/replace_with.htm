<h3><b>Close</b> Button</h3>

If <b>Search Direction</b> is set to <b>Whole Document</b>, search will be performed from the current pointer position to the end of the document and then from the top of the document to the current pointer position.</p>
<h3>Replace Format</h3>
<p><b>Replace</b> not only finds specific text in the body text but also replaces special characters that display tabs, paragraph ends, or line breaks as well as format such as specific font, paragraph, and style in the body text.</p>
