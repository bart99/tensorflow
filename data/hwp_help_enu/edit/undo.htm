<p class="intro">You can revert back from completed actions in the process of document editing by canceling the previous command, deleting typed content, or retrieving deleted content.</p>
<p class="intro2">User actions are remembered step by step. Therefore, you can revert back the edited document to its previous states by repeatedly running Undo.</p>
<p class="intro2"><b>Undo</b> is a useful function that minimizes mistakes that the user makes while editing documents.</p>
<h2><img src="../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Type text in the document on the edit screen or edit the document, for example, by changing fonts.</li>
<li>Click <b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Undo</b>.</li>
<li>Check on the edit screen that the last action has been cancelled.</li>
<li>Click <a href="redo.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Redo</b></a>.</li>
<li>Check that the action cancelled by <b>Undo</b> has been redone.</li>
</ol>
<h2><img src="../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Note</h2>
<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>Click <a href="redo.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Redo</b></a> to redo the command or action cancelled by <b>Undo</b>.</p>
<h3>Run Undo Continuously</h3>
<p>The actions to <b>Undo</b> are a series of typing or editing actions that were performed by the user in the active document and remembered step by step. Running Undo repeatedly brings the same result as canceling the previous actions backward.</p>
<h3>Nothing to Undo</h3>
<p>When you create a new document or open a document by clicking <a href="../file/open/open.htm"><b>Open</b></a>, there is no editing in the document and thus there is no change when you click <b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Undo</b>.</p>
<p><b>Undo</b> is displayed blurred on menus and toolbars and cannot be used.</p>
<h3>Empty Actions to Undo</h3>
<p>When you are editing a document, up to 256 actions to undo are remembered step by step. Once you complete document editing, you can click <a href="../file/close.htm"><b>Close</b></a> to delete all the actions remembered for Undo.</p>
<h3>Range of Undo</h3>
<p>Actions remembered for <b>Undo</b> include content typed and edited in the active document.</p>
<p>When you edit multiple documents at the same time, actions to <b>Undo</b> are remembered separately for each document.</p>
<p>Also, actions that are not related to editing the active document, which include <a href="../file/save/save.htm"><b>Save</b></a>, <a href="../view/toolbar/toolbar(edit).htm"><b>Customize</b></a>, and <b>Zoom</b>, are not remembered for <b>Undo</b>.</p>
