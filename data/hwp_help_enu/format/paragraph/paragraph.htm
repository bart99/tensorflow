<p class="intro">When multiple sentences continue, there is a point where lines change due to context. That is where the unit of thoughts change and it is called <b>paragraph</b>. In Hwp, if you press ENTER while typing, a new paragraph is created.</p>
<p class="intro2">In <b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Paragraph</b>, you can change paragraph left/right margin, indentation/outdentation, alignment, line spacing, paragraph border, paragraph background, paragraph type, and tab settings.</p>
<h2><img src="../../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place the pointer anywhere in a paragraph to change and click <b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Paragraph</b>.</li>
<li>Set alignment method, left margin, right margin, first line style, line spacing, spacing between paragraphs, and paragraph border/background as needed.</li>
<li>After you finish setting paragraph, click <b>Set</b>. The entire paragraph where the pointer was will change.</li>
</ol>
<h2><img src="../../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Note</h2>
<h3>Apply per Paragraph</h3>
<p><b>Paragraph</b> applies per paragraph. If you place the pointer anywhere in a paragraph and change alignment, only the current paragraph will be affected. Paragraphs above or below this paragraph will not be affected.</p>
<p>If you want to apply the same paragraph settings to multiple paragraphs, you have to select the paragraphs as a block and apply the settings.</p>
<h3>Preserve Paragraph</h3>
<p>When you press ENTER, the paragraph and font format at the pointer continues. Unless you change the selected paragraph and font format, the format continues even when you move on to the next paragraph by pressing ENTER.</p>
<h3>View Hard Return</h3>
<p>Allows you to tell paragraph change by line change in a position that is not the end of the right margin. However, paragraph change is not always obvious.</p>
<p>In those cases, click <a href="../../view/displaying_hard_return.htm"><b>View</b> &gt; <b>Hard Return</b></a> to change to <b>View Hard Return</b> mode. Then blue hard return marks <img src="../../images/5f02_001.gif" border="0" alt=""> will appear where ENTER was pressed. Hard returns are only displayed on the screen but not on print-outs.</p>
<h3>Forced Line Change</h3>
<p>When the pointer reaches the right margin of a paragraph as you type, you will automatically move to the next line. When the first couple of characters of a long word reach the right margin and the entire word moves to the next line, the spacing of the previous line becomes too wide and does not look good. In this case, press SHIFT+ENTER at the end of the line to change lines without changing paragraphs.</p>
<p>If you change to <b>View Hard Return</b> mode by clicking <b>View</b> &gt; <b>Hard Return</b>, a blue down arrow бщ will appear in positions where you pressed SHIFT+ENTER.</p>
<h3>Formatting Toolbar</h3>
<p><b>Paragraph Align</b>, <b>Line Spacing</b>, <b>Decrease/Increase Indent</b>, and <b>First Line Outdent</b> that are frequently used in <b>Paragraph</b> are added to the <a href="../../view/toolbar_formatting.htm"><b>Formatting</b></a> toolbar so that you can use them without opening the dialog box.</p>
<h3>Copy Paragraph</h3>
<p>You can copy the paragraph format at the pointer and overwrite another paragraph with it by using <a href="../quick_format/quick_format.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Format Painter</b></a>.</p>
<h3>Paragraph Style</h3>
<p>Register frequently used paragraph styles by using <a href="../style/style.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Styles</b></a>. Once you register a style, you can change the font and paragraph form by applying the style.</p>
<h3>Hard Return and Soft Return</h3>
<p>In a word processor, if you press ENTER while typing, a new <b>paragraph</b> will be created. The place where you change paragraphs by pressing ENTER is called hard return. The place where lines change at the right margin without you pressing ENTER is called soft return.</p>
