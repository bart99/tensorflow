<p class="intro"><b>OLE objects</b> are creations by applications for Windows. In programs like Hwp that are designed for creating documents, documents are objects. In programs designed for creating music, music files are objects. Similarly, objects can be characters, pictures (still pictures, movies), sound, charts, equations, tables, and others.</p>
<p class="intro2"><b>OLE (Object Linking &amp; Embedding)</b> refers to using an organic mixture of various data created by various applications in Windows, instead of using such data independently.</p>
<p class="intro2">One example is embedding graphs, equations, pictures, and even sound data in Hwp documents. Another example is creating instructions for music data of a music program in a document editing program and then embedding the instructions in the music data.</p>
<p class="intro2">The use of such independent data in one application is called OLE (Object Linking &amp; Embedding).</p>
<p class="intro2"><b>Object Linking &amp; Embedding</b> can create efficient documents by using Hwp for document editing and other applications for various purposes.</p>
<h2><img src="../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Steps</h2>
<h3>To apply new OLE</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Insert</b> &gt; <b>OLE</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Insert Object</b> dialog box, select <b>New</b>.</li>
<li>From the <b>Object Type</b> list, select <b>Paint Picture</b> and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>When the Hwp edit window changes to the Paint program, draw a new picture.</li>
<li>When you finish drawing a picture, click <b>File</b> &gt; <b>End Object Editing</b> or click the outside of the Paint area to exit Paint.</li>
<li>The picture will be inserted at the pointer in the document window.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To apply existing OLE</h3>
<p>You can create various objects in advance and embed them in a document when needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Insert</b> &gt; <b>OLE</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Insert Object</b> dialog box, click <b>Create from File</b>. The object type list disappears and a box appears so you can type file name.</li>
<li>Type the path and name of a Painter picture in the <b>File</b> box or select the picture file by clicking <b>Browse</b>.</li>
<li>Select a picture file of Paint and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>The picture will be inserted at the pointer in the document window. Like this, a file object from another application gets embedded in the body text without starting the application. This is different from creating and embedding an object at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<h2><img src="../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Note</h2>
<h3>Comparison of Object Linking and Object Embedding</h3>
<p><b>Object Embedding</b> is much easier to use when inserting an object in a document. If you use this function, however, codes about the object get embedded in the document as well and file size increases accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you use <b>Object Linking</b>, file size does not increase because objects exist as independent files. When you modify an object in another application, the change automatically applies without you applying it during document editing. The use of Object Linking is recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object Linking</strong></li>
<li class="hcp1">
<p class="bullet-list">When two programs share an object and the object which is linked to one of the programs changes, the object will have the same change in the other program.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Object Embedding</strong></li>
<li class="hcp1">
<p class="bullet-list">Changes only apply to the active program without affecting the original object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Show as Icon</h3>
<p>If you select <b>Show as Icon</b>, you can represent visible objects with picture files as they look. However, you cannot insert sound, videos, or special document files directly into the document. You have to display the objects with the icon of the application that can handle them, and connect the icon to the objects. You can check objects displayed as icons by double-clicking the icons.</p>
<h3>Object Linking</h3>
<p>When embedding an existing object, you can choose to link it or not. Selecting <b>Create from File</b> and <b>Link</b> to insert an object, you can edit it by clicking <a href="../edit/objectlink.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>OLE Connection</b></a>.</p>
<h3>Change Object Properties</h3>
<p>Linked or embedded objects inserted in a document are treated as normal objects like pictures, tables, and drawings. So you can modify their size, anchor, and caption by clicking <a href="objectattribute/objectattribute.htm"><b>Home</b> &gt; <b>Object Properties</b></a>.</p>
<h3>Insert Sound</h3>
<p>You can insert sound objects by clicking <a href="wave.htm"><b>Insert</b> &gt; <b>Illustrations</b> &gt; <b>Sound</b></a>.</p>
<h2><img src="../images/dot.gif" border="0" alt=""> Caution</h2>
<h3>Appropriate Application Required</h3>
<p><b>Object Linking &amp; Embedding</b> enables you to use data of different applications. You can also use data from another application without changing the data or embed the result in another application by using this function. You can play or modify the embedded object only if you have an application that can create or view the object. This reduces compatibility in some cases.</p>
